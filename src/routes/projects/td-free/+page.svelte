						Easier isn't possible: Order, wait for the Td-Free to arrive and just plug
						it in. but as the Td-Free isn't any kind of proprietary BS, you can do
						anything with it: Modify the firmware, the case or whatever you want!

						Buy the PCB with everything soldered on in the store and just print your own
						case. Assmeble it and you're ready! You only need black filament for the
						inner parts (2-3 gramms). Choose any color you like for the outer shell or
						even go fancy with some cool combination between lid and case color!

						To build the Td-Free, you'll have to get yourself the parts for the PCB or
						hot glue/duct tape your own stuff together. If you still plan to go with the
						PCB, getting it in the store is cheaper than self-sourcing the components
						and the PCB as there's bulk pricing. The schematics and the PCB design can
						be found in the GitHub repo in form of KiCad files.
