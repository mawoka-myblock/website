# Mawoka's Website

It's a website built with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev)! It's my first website with those tools. The website before this was build with nothing but [Bulma](https://bulma.io). The second version was built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev) and [Bulma](https://bulma.io). That should be everything you need to know. The website then gets deployed to Cloudflare's network with Cloudflare Workers.
